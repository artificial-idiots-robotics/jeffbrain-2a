# Jeffbrain 2
## Program C
Jeffbrain 2 is the software for our VEX V5 robot, which we've named Jeff 2.

This is Jeffbrain 2 (Program C), which is written in C++. There are two other versions of the program.

See jeffbrain2-a and jeffbrain2-b for more information.

Jeffbrain 2 (Program C) is our most advanced version of Jeffbrain 2.

It uses LVGL for its interface, allowing settings to be updated quickly, stats to be monitored properly, and Minnow to be displayed cutely. (Minnow is Aiden's sister's cat.)

The autonomous routines and operator control use LemLib for precise measurement, and also because we plan to add more motors to Jeff 2 at some point. We're still working on making it actually function for now. We got completely destroyed last competition.
